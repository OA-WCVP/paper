# Introduction

### Aim
The aim of this paper is to explore patterns of open access publication of new plant taxa and to make recommendations to better support the research necessary to document and conserve plant diversity in the most species rich or threatened areas. Naming of new taxa is an essential service, enabling us to interact with existing bodies of knowledge - as Linneaus warned us: *nomina si nescis, perit et cognitio rurem* (if you do not know the names, your knowledge gets lost) [@Linnaeus1792]. Accurate naming is also essential to develop our understanding of newly described organisms. We cannot protect what we have not named: legislative protection of species cannot proceed without a formal species description.

Despite the importance of naming, and the many uses of a comprehensive taxonomic system, progress towards documenting and understanding plant diversity is challenged by the "taxonomic impediment". First introduced in 1976 this term has become a shorthand for the skills (and resources) gap [@taylor1976submission; @taylor1983descriptive]. Access to the necessary skills and resources is uneven, and when viewed globally actually mismatches the areas of greatest need: the most species-rich areas are often the most resource-poor (Mayr et al. 2016).The distribution of preserved plant specimens has been influenced by colonial history, with comprehensive plant collections having been developed in the global north, whilst the areas richest in species diversity are often located in the tropics (Paton et al. 2020 more).   The enormous wealth of existing collections mean that many as yet un-named species are already lodged in preserved collections, awaiting examination and description [@bebber2010] and incresingly digitsation is providing free open access to these specimens [@soltis2017].  However, it is necessary to build capacity in species rich areas to properly document plant diversity in the most threatened areas and focus conservation action [@fazey2005;@cheek2020].   Although it could be argued that the taxonomic impediment is in part due to the shortage of taxonomists [@engel2021], we believe that open access to information is critically important as it facilitates the training of researchers, the circumscription of taxa and provides the basis conservation action. Around 2000 new vascular plant species are described each year, most new species are described are likely to have narrow distributions and to be threatened [@niclughadha2020].

### Global scale A 
(Distribution of species / specimens)

Species description is on-going, arising from field activities and from the better understanding of existing resources.

(Hotspots, where new species are still being collected / described. Example: Ebo?)  not sure we need this paragraph
Researchers in plant diversity and distribution recognise "hotspots" - places where significant numbers of endemic species are found and from which new species are still being described. 

(Collections as place of discovery. Example: Victoria?)


- List names published in 2021 with oldest collected type material

### Importance of resources  
- Type specimens / Literature  
- Digital access  
- Population of resources (digital repositories)

### Publishing overview - general trends  
 - Open access  
- Hopes for open access  
- Types of open access (define green, gold, hybrid, bronze, diamond etc)

### Publishing overview - taxonomic  
- Role of code  
- Recent changes, future directions  
- Conflation of e-publication with open access? (Melbourne code discussions)

### Data integration work  
- Material citations  
- GBIF clustering  
- Bionomia
- Digital extended specimen

### Related work  
- State of collections  
- Number of specimens available, future work  
- Take-up of electronic publishing (taxonomy)  
    We looked at the takeup of e-publication [@nicolson_impact_2017].
- Take-up of open access (generally)
