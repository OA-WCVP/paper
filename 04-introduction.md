# Introduction

### Aim
The aim of this paper is to explore patterns of open access publication of new plant taxa and to make recommendations to better support the research necessary to document and conserve plant diversity in the most species rich or threatened areas. Naming of new taxa is an essential service, enabling us to interact with existing bodies of knowledge - as Linneaus warned us: *nomina si nescis, perit et cognitio rurem* (if you do not know the names, your knowledge gets lost) [@Linnaeus1792]. Accurate naming is also essential to develop our understanding of newly described organisms. We cannot protect what we have not named: legislative protection of species cannot proceed without a formal species description.

Despite the importance of naming, and the many uses of a comprehensive taxonomic system, progress towards documenting and understanding plant diversity is challenged by the “taxonomic impediment”. This term was first introduced in 1976 and is a shorthand for the skills (and resources) gap in taxonomy [@taylor1976submission; @taylor1983descriptive]. Access to the necessary skills and resources is uneven, and when viewed globally actually mismatches the areas of greatest need: the most species-rich areas are often the most resource-poor [@Meyer2016].

The adoption of the type method into plant taxonomy means that there is an intimate connection between the names of plants and their type specimens in collections. The distribution of these preserved specimens has been influenced by colonial history, with comprehensive plant collections having been developed in the Global North, whilst the areas richest in species diversity are often located in the tropics [@paton_plant_2020]. Indeed, the enormous wealth of existing collections mean that many as yet un-named taxa already lodged in preserved collections, awaiting examination and description [@bebber2010]. Incresingly digitsation is providing free open access to these specimens [@soltis2017]. However, it is necessary to build human and infrastructural capacity in species rich areas to properly document plant diversity in the most threatened areas and in order to focus conservation action [@fazey2005;@cheek2020]. Although it could be argued that the taxonomic impediment is in part due to the shortage of taxonomists [@engel2021], we believe that open access to information is also a critical aspect as it facilitates the training of researchers, the circumscription of taxa and provides the basis conservation action. Around two thousand vascular plant species are described each year, and most of them are likely to have narrow distributions and to be threatened with extinction [@niclughadha2020].

### Global scale A 
(Distribution of species / specimens)

Species description is on-going, arising from field activities and from the better understanding of existing resources.

(Hotspots, where new species are still being collected / described. Example: Ebo?)  not sure we need this paragraph
Researchers in plant diversity and distribution recognise "hotspots" - places where significant numbers of endemic species are found and from which new species are still being described. 

(Collections as place of discovery. Example: Victoria?)


- List names published in 2021 with oldest collected type material

### Importance of resources  
- Type specimens / Literature  
- Digital access  
- Population of resources (digital repositories)

### Publishing overview - general trends  
 - Open access  
- Hopes for open access  
- Types of open access (define green, gold, hybrid, bronze, diamond etc)

A foundational event of the Open Access movement was the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI)[@Chan2002]. It was recognised in the initiative that scholarly publications were an important and public good, that, with the advent of the internet, could be shared completely freely to all those who wanted to read it, whether out of need or curiosity. By removing barriers to scientific literature it was hoped that open access would “*... accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge*” [@Chan2002]. The Initiative recommended two complementary strategies to achieve these goals, firstly self-archiving in open repositories (so called green open access) and publication in completely open access journals (so called gold open access), usually associated with an article processing charge to the author. Subsequently other shades of open access publication have emerged. Hybrid open access required an article processing charge to publish openly in an otherwise closed journal. Bronze open access is a journal that is freely available to read, but does not have an open access license. Finally, diamond open access where the publication is openly licensed, but neither the author nor the reader pays charges.
