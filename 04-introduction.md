# Introduction

### Aim
The aim of this paper is explore patterns of open access publication of new species.  Naming of new taxa is an essential service, enabling us to interact with existing bodies of knowledge - as Linneaus warned us: *nomina si nescis, perit et cognitio rurem* (if you do not know the names, your knowledge gets lost) [@Linnaeus1792]. Accurate naming is also essential to develop our understanding of newly described organisms. We cannot protect what we have not named:  legislative protection of species cannot proceed without a formal species description. 

Despite the importance of naming, and the many uses of a comprehensive taxonomic system, progress towards documenting and understanding plant diversity is challenged by the "taxonomic impediment". First introduced in 1976 this term has become a shorthand for the skills (and resources) gap [@taylor1976submission; @taylor1983descriptive]. Access to the necessary skills and resources is uneven, and when viewed globally actually mismatches the areas of greatest need: the most species-rich areas are often the most resource-poor (Mayr et al. 2016; Paton et al. 2020).  It is important to build capacity  in species rich areas to properly document plant diversity and focus conservation action (Cheek 2020).  Around 2000 new vascular plant species are described each year, many new species are described have narrow distributions and are likely to be threatened (Niclughadha et al. 2020). Although it could be argued that the taxonomic impediment is caused by  the shortage of taxonomists (Engel et al. 2021), we believe that access to information is just as important as it facilitates the training of researchers and provides the basis conservation action. 

### Global scale AP i think this it is diverging from the main thrust of the paper- support incountry capacity through open access data.  
(Distribution of species / specimens)
The distribution of preserved plant specimens has been influenced by colonial history, with comprehensive plant collections being developed in the global north, whilst the areas richest in species diversity are often located in the tropics.

Species description is on-going, arising from field activities and from the better understanding of existing resources.

(Hotspots, where new species are still being collected / described. Example: Ebo?)
Researchers in plant diversity and distribution recognise "hotspots" - places where significant numbers of endemic species are found and from which new species are still being described. 

(Collections as place of discovery. Example: Victoria?)
In addition to in-field species discovery, we also recognise that the enormous wealth of existing collections mean that many as yet un-named species are already lodged in preserved collections, awaiting examination and description.
