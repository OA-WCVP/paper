# Summary

We review digital access to literature and type specimens, key resources for taxonomic research. Takeup of Open Access (OA) publishing in vascular plants naming is analysed using data from the International Plant Names Index (IPNI), and online availability of digitised specimen data analysed using data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Integration of the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) taxonomy and  distributional data (recorded using the hierarchical World Geographic Scheme for Recording Plant Distriutions, WGSRPD to level 3) has allowed us to also examine regional variation.

A minority of vascular plant names are published in OA literature and much relevant literature is digitally undiscoverable, as it is issued without a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The most common OA publishing model used is gold. 31% of taxa are represented by a digitised type specimen mobilised from within the continent (WGSRPD level 1) of their natural range. The WGSRPD hierarchical model for geographical distribution shows that 20% of taxa are represented by types mobilised from within the region of their natural range (WGSRPD level 2); 12% from within the area (WGSRPD level 3).

We recommend clear waivers for authors from low and middle income countries to better enable "gold" OA, and promotion of deposition repositories better enable "green" OA. Nomenclators should clearly indicate the OA status of bibliographic references, and mobilise type citation data as material citations to aggregators like GBIF. Names registration systems should promote the capture of code-recommended elements such as catalogue numbers for type specimens. Digital mobilisation of specimen metadata and images from collections based in low and middle income countries must be accelerated to help increase in country taxonomic capacity to document and conserve plant diversity.
