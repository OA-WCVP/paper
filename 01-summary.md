# Summary

We provide a review of the current levels of digital access to key resources - literature and type specimens - necessary to conduct taxonomic research. We have analysed the takeup of open access publishing among the authors of new species names in vascular plants using data from the International PLant Names Index (IPNI), and examined the online availability of digitised specimen data using data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Integration of the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) taxonomy and  distributional data (recorded using the hierarchical World Geographic Scheme for Recording Plant Distriutions, WGSRPD to level 3) has allowed us to also examine how these trends vary regionally.

We find that a minority of vascular plant names are published in open access literature and much relevant literature is digitally undiscoverable, as it is not labelled with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The most common open access publishing model used is gold, which may exacerbate global inequalities due to the association with author-funded article processing charges.
We find that 31% of taxa are represented by a digitised type specimen mobilised from within the continent (WGSRPD level 1) of their natural range. By using the WGSRPD hierarchical model for geographical distribution, we can further see that 20% of taxa are represented by type material mobilised from within the region of their natural range (WGSRPD level 2); 12% from within the area (WGSRPD level 3).

We recommend clear publisher guidelines on waivers for authors from low income countries to better enable gold open access, and an expansion in the use of deposition repositories to hold published articles to better enable "green" open access. Nomenclators should also more clearly indicate the open access status of containing literature, and authors and nomenclators should mobilise type citation data as material citations to aggregators like GBIF. Names registration systems currently being developed to populate nomenclators should promote the capture of code-recommended elements such as catalogue numbers for type specimens. Digital mobilisation of specimen metadata and images from collections based in low income countries must be accelerated to help increase in country taxonomic capacity to document and conserve plant diversity.
