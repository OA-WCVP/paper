# Summary

We provide a review of the current levels of digital access to key resources - literature and specimens - necessary to conduct taxonomic research. Using the WCVP taxonomy, we have analysed the takeup of open access publishing among the authors of new species names in vascular plants, and examined the online availability of digitised specimen data using type citations recorded from protologues. Integration of the WCVP distributional data has allowed us to also examine how these trends vary regionally.

We find that a minority of vascular plant names are published in open access literature. The most common open access model used is gold (or "author pays"), which may exacerbate global inequalities.
We find that 31% of taxa are represented by a type specimen mobilised from within the continent of their natural range. At increasing levels of spatial precision, 20% of taxa are represented by type material mobilised from within the region of their natural range; 12% from within the area (or "botanical country").

We recommend clear publisher guidelines on waivers for authors from low income countries to better enable gold open access, and an expansion in the use of deposition repositories to hold published articles to better enable "green" open access. Nomenclators should also more clearly indicate the open access status of containing literature, and mobilise type citation data as material citations to aggregators like GBIF. Names registration systems currently being developed to populate nomenclators should promote the capture of code-recommended elements such as catalogue numbers for type specimens. Digital mobilisation of specimen metadata and images from collections based in low income countries must be accelerated.
