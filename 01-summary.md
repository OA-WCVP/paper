# Summary

We review access to literature and type specimens, key resources for taxonomic research. Takeup of Open Access (OA) publishing in plant naming is analysed using the International Plant Names Index (IPNI) published between $year_min$ and $year_max$, and online availability of specimens analysed using the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Integration of the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) taxonomy and  distributional data (recorded using the World Geographic Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, WGSRPD to level 3) is use to examine regional variation.

$nomenclatural_act_open_pc$% of vascular plant names are published OA, and $nomenclatural_act_undiscoverable_pc$% are digitally undiscoverable, as they are contained in bibliographic works without a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or with a DOI that does not resolve. The most common OA publishing model used is "gold". 31% of taxa are represented by a digitised type specimen mobilised from within the continent (WGSRPD level 1) of their natural range. 

We recommend clear article processing charge (APC) waivers for authors from low and middle income countries to better enable "gold" OA, and promotion of deposition repositories to better enable "green" OA. Nomenclators should clearly indicate the OA status of bibliographic references, and mobilise type citation data as material citations to aggregators like GBIF. Names registration systems should promote the capture of code-recommended elements such as catalogue numbers for type specimens. Digital mobilisation of specimen metadata and images from collections based in low and middle income countries must be accelerated to help increase in country taxonomic capacity to document and conserve plant diversity.
