## Abstract submission information

### Data usage

We intend to use the following data sources: 

- WCVP
- IPNI
- Unpaywall
- GBIF (preserved specimen occurrences, material citations, taxon treatments) 
- Index Herbariorum
- (Biodiversity Heritage Library) 

WCVP will be used to give a globally comprehensive taxonomy with distribution. The link from a taxon concept in WCVP to the nomenclatural event in IPNI will be used to gather two classes of additional data recorded in IPNI: (1) type citation data (recorded since 1997) and (2) article digital object identifiers (DOIs), recorded since 2012. Type citation data will be used to assess the digital availability of type specimens, using GBIF as a datasource. A more general assessment of the availability of specimens will be made using the WCVP taxonomy as a lookup to the GBIF occurrence data on preserved specimens. On a regional level (using distributions from WCVP), these will be compared to the total number of specimens available using numbers derived from metadata records in Index Herbariorum. Bibliographic data (DOIs) will be used to flag if the first publication of each name is available open access by looking up the DOI in the Unpaywall dataset, and again WCVP will be used to assess if this varies regionally. Depending on the state of the WCVP bibliographic data (cited as a reference supporting taxonomic status, ie the assertion of acceptance or synonymisation), it may be possible to make an assessment of the presence of relevant literature in the Biodiversity Heritage Library, and again, to see how this varies regionally, using WCVP distributions.

### Research questions

1. How does the availability of the key resources necessary for botanical research (types, specimens and literature) vary geographically? 
1. How the distribution of resources relates to vascular plant diversity at country level?

### Scientific novelty

- Use of WCVP geographic distribution data to assess regional specimen availability 
- Open access assessment of literature: open access takeup has been assessed generally across scholarly communications, but not specifically in the botanical taxonomic literature. 
- Being able to combine diverse datasets to assess the availability of, and gaps in, the botanical data necessary for taxonomic research to support policy.

### Analyses

The nature of the question and the data do not require sophisticated statistical analysis. Some of the results will consist of complete counts or ratios of all existing data. Other results will be presented as maps and rankings of countries. We might also include basic correlations of the results with other data on countries and collections, such as the gross domestic product of political countries or the number of researchers at herbaria from Index Herbariorum.
