# Societal impact statement

Primary plant occurrence data (“what, where, when”) enable study of distribution and diversity, facilitating reactions to societal challenges from food security to climate change mitigation. Scientific names integrate information, and are reified via a type specimen. Research and conservation planning requires timely open access to this data.
Around 2000 vascular plant species are described each year, many are narrowly endemic and face conservation threats. $oa_annual_pc_avg$% of those published between $year_min$ and $year_max$ are available openly, and only $taxa2nativerangetypeavailability.area_code_l3.taxon_represented_pc$% of taxa are represented by digitised type material served from within their native range. We make several recommendations to increase open access.
