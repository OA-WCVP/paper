# Discussion

A decade after electronic publication was adopted by the botanical community with the hope that it would make plant diversity information more openly and widely accessible, it is clear that despite initial uptake [@nicolson_impact_2017], we show that xx % of the  literature associated with new names for taxa remains undiscoverable by by electronic means (Fig. X). This does not mean that this information is not available in electronic space, but the lack of identifiers means that searching for, retrieving and ultimately refinding such resources is time-consuming and can be costly. This may not seem a problem for individuals and institutions with access to computers and server time, but for those botanists working in institutions where a single computer is available for all staff or who use mobile data for searches, this is a significant barrier. 

We outline below some specific recommendations for actions that could aid accessibility to resources and future research that can further analyse the situation:

**Nomenclators** have a potential role in promoting the understanding of open access amongst both authors and users of nomenclature. We recommend that flags are displayed alongside nomenclatural act records to indicate the OA status of the containing work. The publication record could also indicate its presence in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

**Institutions** which maintain their own publication repositories should ensure that they are included in the sources searched by unpaywall (https://unpaywall.org/sources) and encourage staff to self-archive where possible.

**Journals** which currently publish online but which do not assign DOIs to their content (categorised as undiscoverable in this analysis), should assign DOIs. There could be a role for collaborative projects like the Biodiversity Heritage Library (who are assigning DOIs to historic content through initiatives such as their RetroPIDSs project) to also assign DOIs to more recent content which they display - eg articles in the title "Phytoneuron" which are archived in BHL and include ==1646== currently undiscoverable nomenclatural acts. Eligible journals should register in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

**Publishers** could shorten the embargo period for articles with nomenclatural content, to allow broader dissemination through self-archiving.
    
**Future research work**: ability to use OA  

    - examination of affiliations  
    - career stage seniority  
    - collaboration makeup  
    - roles (nomenclatural acts where author is also collector)
