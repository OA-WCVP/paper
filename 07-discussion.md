**Recommendations**:

**Nomenclators** have a potential role in promoting the understanding of open access amongst both authors and users of nomenclature. We recommend that flags are displayed alongside nomenclatural act records to indicate the OA status of the containing work. The publication record could also indicate its presence in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

**Institutions** which maintain their own publication repositories should ensure that they are included in the sources searched by unpaywall (https://unpaywall.org/sources) and encourage staff to self-archive where possible.

**Journals** which currently publish online but which do not assign DOIs to their content (categorised as undiscoverable in this analysis), should assign DOIs. There could be a role for collaborative projects like the Biodiversity Heritage Library (who are assigning DOIs to historic content through initiatives such as their RetroPIDSs project) to also assign DOIs to more recent content which they display - eg articles in the title "Phytoneuron" which are archived in BHL and include ==1646== currently undiscoverable nomenclatural acts. Eligible journals should register in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

**Publishers** could shorten the embargo period for articles with nomenclatural content, to allow broader dissemination through self-archiving.

**Future infrastructure work**  
    - IPNI registration system  
    - Institutional repositories
    
**Future research work**: ability to use OA  

    - examination of affiliations  
    - career stage seniority  
    - collaboration makeup  
    - roles (nomenclatural acts where author is also collector)
