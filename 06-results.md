Our dataset extracted from IPNI comprised $nomenclatural_act_count$ nomenclatural act records published in $publications_total$ different publications between $year_min$ and $year_max$. $dois_from_ipni$ of these had DOIs recorded in IPNI, $dois_from_col$ were backfilled with DOIs recorded in the Catalogue of Life. We found that each year, the IPNI dataset include acts published in an average of $publications_annual_mean$ different publications (n=$number_of_years$). $nomenclatural_act_proportion_in_serial$% of names are published in serials. The spike in numbers of nomenclatural acts published for 2018 was caused by the large volume of combinations ($nomenclatural_act_glovap_count$) published in GLOVAP [@christenhusz2018global]. 
On average each year, less than one quarter ($oa_annual_pc_avg$%) of nomenclatural acts are published open access. We did not observe a trend towards open access throughout the time period analysed (figure  @fig:fig2 (a)). When looking at the kinds of open access used (figure  @fig:fig2 (b)), we find that *gold* dominates. Here we do find a small difference through time, with *green* (self-archiving) showing a slightly greater representation in the earlier years in the study.
When analysing the data by publication, we find that many journals active in the publication of nomenclatural acts are undiscoverable - the containing bibliographic work is not labelled with a DOI. (figure  @fig:fig3 - or the acts are labelled with a DOI which is now unresolvable ($dois_unresolvable$ in total, in $publications_w_unresolvable_dois$ different publications).
