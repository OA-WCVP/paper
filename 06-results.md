# Results

Our dataset extracted from IPNI comprised ==X== nomenclatural act records published between ==2012== and ==2021==. We found that each year, the IPNI dataset include acts published in an average of ==Y== different publications (n=10). ==y==% of names are published in serials. The spike in numbers of nomenclatural acts published for 2018 was caused by the large volume of combinations (3710) published in GLOVAP [@christenhusz2018global]. 
Each year, less than one third of nomenclatural acts are published open access. We did not observe a trend towards open access throughout the time period analysed (figure  @fig:fig2 (a)). When looking at the kinds of open access used (figure  @fig:fig2 (b)), we find that *gold* dominates. Here we do find a difference through time, with *green* (self-archiving) showing a greater representation in the earlier years in the study.
When analysing the data by publication, we find that many journals active in the publication of nomenclatural acts are undiscoverable - the containing bibliographic work is not labelled with a DOI. (figure  @fig:fig3)
