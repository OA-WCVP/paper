Article draft for "Global access to botanical resources: assessing the digital availability of types and specimens and open access literature"

## Abstract

The study of vascular plants has benefitted from recent efforts in digitisation, with 83.4 million records mobilised through the GBIF network (as of 2022-01-31) and c. 2500 species newly described each year (statistics from ipni.org, 2022-01-31). Alongside the effort to mobilise these primary specimen-derived data, a complementary approach is expanding the use of literature as a data source, using text-mining approaches and the recent adoption of the "material citation" concept (a reference to a specimen in literature). As these data come onstream, work has started to improve the linkages between these data items, examples include the experimental work in the GBIF data portal to "cluster" related records: e.g. specimens gathered from a shared collecting event, specimens and their "material citation" references in literature, or specimens and observations arising from the same field research activities. Though a wealth of data is available digitally and eligible for linking, this still represents a fraction of the total available (Index Herbariorum 2021 report suggests 396 million herbarium specimens extant worldwide). The release of the WCVP taxonomy with distribution now offers a comprehensive index with which these digitally available data can be analysed. This study will use the WCVP taxonomy, its underpinning nomenclature and geographic distribution as a key integration tool to analyse the digital availability of the key resources needed to effectively research vascular plant taxonomy (types, specimens and literature, and ready availability of these data through open access publishing), and how access to these varies across different regions. The integration of these different datasets will identify gaps in the availability of data on vascular plant diversity at a national, regional and global level. Understanding this variation in access will help form effective policy recommendations to focus future activities.
