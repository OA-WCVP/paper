  abstract = {At the Nomenclature Section of the XVIII International Botanical Congress in Melbourne, Australia (IBC), the botanical community voted to allow electronic publication of nomenclatural acts for algae, fungi and plants, and to abolish the rule requiring Latin descriptions or diagnoses for new taxa. Since the 1st January 2012, botanists have been able to publish new names in electronic journals and may use Latin or English as the language of description or diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28\% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45\%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47\% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18\% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.},

  abstract = {This second edition of The Code Decoded is a user\&rsquo;s guide to the\&nbsp;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, specifically\&nbsp;the Shenzhen Code of 2018. The author has tried to create a text that is\&nbsp;reasonably clear and simple, but not oversimplified, using plain language\&nbsp;as far as possible, and explaining necessary technical terms. The chapters\&nbsp;are arranged so that the guide may be used for quick reference, e.g.\&nbsp;important dates for certain rules, how to publish a new name, how to find\&nbsp;the correct name for a taxon, how to designate a type, how to propose a name for conservation or rejection, or even how to try to change the Code itself. Again with quick reference in mind, the text uses subheadings, boxes, bulleted lists, tables, figures, and boldface key words. This edition\&nbsp;has been augmented by much new content and is fully updated to be\&nbsp;compatible with the Shenzhen Code.},
