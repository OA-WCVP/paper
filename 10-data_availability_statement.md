# Data availability statement

All data access, analysis, result visualisation and document compilation outlined here was automated using a toolkit based on *Python* scripts using *pandas* and *geopandas* for data management and *matplotlib* for charting. Execution and dependencies were managed by the build tool *make*, which generated an archivable output which was attached to each analytical repository. *Github actions* were used to download analysis results and to compile the article document using *pandoc* and *latex*. 

WCVP data are available from RBG Kew at [http://sftp.kew.org/pub/data-repositories/WCVP/Special_Issue_28_Feb_2022/](http://sftp.kew.org/pub/data-repositories/WCVP/Special_Issue_28_Feb_2022/). All analytical code is openly licenced and available on github at: [https://github.com/OA-WCVP](https://github.com/OA-WCVP).
